= OpenShift AI

Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) builds on the capabilities of Red Hat OpenShift to provide a single, consistent, enterprise-ready hybrid AI and MLOps platform. It provides tools across the full lifecycle of AI/ML experiments and models including training, serving, monitoring, and managing AI/ML models and AI-enabled applications.

Red Hat OpenShift AI is a flexible and scalable MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) platform designed to provide organizations with a consistent environment for building, training, deploying, and monitoring artificial intelligence and machine learning models and applications. Built on the foundation of Red Hat OpenShift, an enterprise Kubernetes platform, it offers data scientists, developers, and ML engineers a comprehensive set of tools and capabilities to streamline the entire AI/ML lifecycle, from experimentation and development to production deployment and management at scale. Its primary goal is to accelerate the delivery of AI-powered applications by providing a robust, collaborative, and cloud-native platform.

The platform integrates various open-source technologies and partner offerings, providing a curated collection of tools for tasks such as data preparation, model development using familiar environments like Jupyter notebooks, model training, serving, and monitoring. It emphasizes MLOps principles by facilitating automation, reproducibility, and collaboration across different teams involved in AI projects. By leveraging the underlying infrastructure of Red Hat OpenShift, OpenShift AI benefits from its scalability, security features, and ability to run consistently across hybrid cloud environments (on-premises, public cloud, or edge), enabling organizations to manage their AI workloads efficiently and effectively.
