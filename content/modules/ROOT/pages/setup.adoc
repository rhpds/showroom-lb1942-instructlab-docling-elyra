= OpenShift AI

Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) builds on the capabilities of Red Hat OpenShift to provide a single, consistent, enterprise-ready hybrid AI and MLOps platform. It provides tools across the full lifecycle of AI/ML experiments and models including training, serving, monitoring, and managing AI/ML models and AI-enabled applications.

== Deploy a Model

We'll be deploying a quantized version of an LLM so we can run it on a CPU. Quantized LLMs have been converted from high-precision floating-point numbers to lower-precision data types to reduce its size and increase computational speed.

. Go to your *Data Science Project* and click on *Models*. We'll be using the single-model serving platform. Click *Select single-model*.
