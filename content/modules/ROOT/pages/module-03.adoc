== Elyra Overview[[elyra]]

Elyra is a set of AI-centric extensions to JupyterLab, and its pipeline capabilities are a core feature. Here's an overview of Elyra pipelines:

*Visual Pipeline Editor*

Elyra provides a visual interface for creating and managing data science and machine learning pipelines. This allows users to construct workflows by dragging and dropping components (like Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts) onto a canvas and connecting them.

*Pipeline Nodes*

Pipelines are composed of nodes, where each node represents a specific task. These tasks can be:

* Executing Jupyter notebooks.
* Running Python scripts.
* Running R scripts.

These nodes can have dependencies, defining the order of execution.

*Runtime Flexibility*

Elyra pipelines are designed to be flexible and can be executed on various platforms:

* Local/JupyterLab
* Apache Airflow
* Kubeflow Pipelines

*Runtime Configurations*

Elyra uses runtime configurations to store metadata about the target execution environment. This allows pipelines to be portable across different platforms.

*Generic and Runtime-Specific Pipelines*

Elyra supports both generic pipelines (which can run on multiple platforms) and runtime-specific pipelines (which are designed for a particular platform).

//// 
*Key Features and Benefits*

* Simplified Workflow Creation: The visual editor makes it easier to create complex workflows without writing extensive code.
* Increased Productivity: By automating tasks and managing dependencies, Elyra helps data scientists and machine learning engineers focus on their core work.
* Improved Reproducibility: Pipelines provide a consistent and reproducible way to execute workflows.
* Scalability: Integration with platforms like Kubeflow Pipelines enables scalable execution of machine learning workflows.
* Portability: The ability to run pipelines on different platforms provides flexibility and avoids vendor lock-in.

=== Steps

. We'll start by taking a look at our data science pipeline. 

+
Open the *elyra_docling_rh_summit/openshift_solution* directory and open the *elyra-docling-pipeline.pipeline*. Click on the *Ingest Files* node and then click on the *Open Panel* icon to view the node properties.

+

. Elyra provides a lot of flexibility and configuration of nodes within a pipeline. The Filename and Runtime Image properties are required for every node.

+
This node runs the *copy_files.py* Python script with the *Datascience with Python 3.11 (UBI9)* runtime image.  

+
image::openshift/ingest-node-properties.png[Ingest node properties,100%,100%]

. Click on the *Pipeline Parameters* for the *Ingest Files* node. Note that we are using a parameter nameed *_minio_url_* in the s3 object store URL. Each node in the pipeline can use this parameter to connect to s3 storage.

. Click on the *open runtimes* icon. This OpenShift AI workbench image has the Data Science Pipelines runtimes pre-configured. Note the Data Science Pipelines API Endpoint points to your OpenShift AI instance.

. Feel free to take a look at the other nodes in the pipeline as well to see what properties are configured and what code they run.

== Docling Overview[[docling]]

image::openshift/docling-workflow-image.png[Docling overview,80%,80%]

Docling is an open-source toolkit designed to streamline the process of converting various document formats, particularly PDFs, into structured data that's readily usable by AI applications. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

*Document Conversion*

Docling excels at parsing diverse document formats, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, and images.
It transforms these documents into a unified, structured representation, facilitating data extraction.

*Advanced PDF Understanding*

A significant focus is on sophisticated PDF processing, going beyond basic text extraction.
It analyzes page layout, determines reading order, and accurately recovers table structures.
It can also understand other complex elements like code, formulas, and image classification.

*AI-Driven:*

Docling leverages state-of-the-art AI models, notably for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer).
This AI-powered approach enables more accurate and nuanced document interpretation compared to traditional methods.

*Integration with AI Ecosystem:*
It's designed to seamlessly integrate with popular AI frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.
This makes it a valuable tool for applications involving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other LLM-driven tasks.

*Open-Source and Accessible:*
Docling is released under the MIT license, promoting collaboration and community development.
It's designed to run efficiently on standard hardware, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

*Key Features:*

- Ability to handle scanned PDFs with robust OCR support.
- Flexible output formats (JSON, Markdown, HTML).
- Local execution capabilities for data privacy.
- Command-line interface (CLI) and Python API.
- Donated to the https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/docling/[Linux Foundation] in April 2025

In essence, Docling aims to bridge the gap between unstructured document data and the structured data needs of modern AI applications.

=== Steps

. In your workbench with the *elyra-docling-pipeline.pipeline* open,  double click on the *Docling* node. This should open the *../../instruct-generate/ingest-summit.ipynb* Jupyter notebook. 

+
image::openshift/elyra-pdf-converter.png[Elyra PDF Converter Node,100%,100%]

. Notice in the first cell of the notebook we install docling. After docling is installed we load the PDF and DOCX documents. 

+
image::openshift/ingest-summit-notebook.png[ingest-summit-notebook,100%,100%]

. Scroll down the notebook to the last two cells. This is where we're converting the different file types into markdown with Docling. 
- The DocumnetConverter is configured to only convert files with PDF and DOCX extensions. 
- If the file type is PDF a StandardPdfPipeline will be used, if the file type is DOCX a SimplePipeline will be used.
- In the last cell the files are saved as markdown (.md) files.

== Q&A Generator[[qna]]
The Q&A generator uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate questions and answer pairs from a markdown file. These questions and answers can be included in the final qna.yaml file that will be used by InstructLab for fine tuning.

=== Steps

. Open the *elyra-docling-pipeline.pipeline* file and double click on the *QNA Generator* node. The *injest-splitter* file should open.

+
image::openshift/qna-pipeline-node.png[QNA Node,100%,100%]

. Scroll down the notebook until you get to the cell where we're using the llamaindex OpenLLM connector to connect to an LLM. Note that we need to configure a model name, model URL endpoint, and the model token. In the next section we'll configure the OS environments so we have the correct values.

+
image::openshift/injest-splitter-openllm.png[OpenLLM Config,100%,100%]

. Scroll down to the cell with the process_chunk function. This is where we send a request to the LLM to generate our question and answer paris from the provided markdown file.
