== Let's Run the Data Science Pipeline![[dsprun]]

To run the data science pipeline on OpenShift AI all we need to do is upload a file to our *upload-bucket* in Minio. That will notify our event listener a new file has been uploaded to the bucket and the event listener along with the trigger template will start our OpenShift AI Data Science Pipeline.

NOTE: To interact with Minio we'll need to use a python script (we can't download/upload files on the lab laptops).  

. Go back to your OpenShift AI workbench and open the *elyra_docling_rh_summit/openshift_solution/minio_utilities* directory. 
+
Open the *upload-file-to-s3.py* file and click the *Run* icon at the top. This python script will upload a PDF to our Minio s3 bucket (upload-bucket). 

+

. Our event listener should have received the notification from the Minio event that a new file was uploaded and should have triggered a new pipeline run. 

+
Go back to you OpenShift web console and select the *Pipelines* from the left hand menu. Click on *PipelineRuns*. 

+
You should see a successful pipeline run.

. Let's take a look at our OpenShift AI pipeline run. Open your OpenShift AI dashboard and click *Experiments* -> *Experiments and Runs* from the left menu. 

+
Select the *Default* experiment. You should see that a pipeline has started, but hasn't finished yet. That's because it's waiting at our HITL markdown review task.

TODO - get screenshot of DSP pipeline to review status after it's initially started.

. Let's review the markdown file so we can move the pipeline along.

+
. Go back to your OpenShift AI workbench and open the *elyra_docling_rh_summit/openshift_solution/minio_utilities* directory. 
+
Open the *HITL-review-markdown.py* file and click the *Run* icon at the top. This python script will download a PDF named _docling-markdown-review.md_ to the local directory.

+

. Open the _docling-markdown-review.md_ file and check for any processing errors e.g. table alignment, list numbering

For example:

This is a page from the original PDF, notice the elements in the footer

image::openshift/summit-pdf-render.png[HITL PDF render,100%,100%]

*But the Markdown output has list numbering issues due to the items in the footer*

image::openshift/markdown-error.png[HITL PDF render,100%,100%]

*This would have to be fixed before continuing, for example*

+
When you're done reviewing the markdown file close it and rename the file _docling-markdown-approved.md_ run the *HITL_upload_markdown.py*. This will upload our reviewed markdown file to an s3 bucket and our QNA Generator node will pull download it to generate the qna.yaml file.

NOTE: You can right-click on the file and select *Rename* to update the file name.

. TODO: THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO THE RHOA PIPELINE TO SEE THAT IT MOVED TO THE QNA REVIEW NODE.

. Our final step is to review the generated qna.yaml file. 

+
. Go back to your OpenShift AI workbench and open the *elyra_docling_rh_summit/openshift_solution/minio_utilities* directory. 
+
Open the *HITL-review-qna.py* file and click the *Run* icon at the top. This python script will download a PDF named _qna-review_me.yaml_ to the local directory.

+
image::openshift/minio-utils-hitl-qna-review.png[HITL qna review,100%,100%]

. Open the _qna-review-me.yaml_ file. TODO: WHAT DO WE WANT THEM TO DO HERE? 

+
When you're done reviewing the markdown file close it and rename the file _qna.yaml_ and run the *HITL_upload_qna.py*. This will upload our reviewed qna.yaml file to data-files-bucket in Minio.

+
Your pipeline should be completed now!
