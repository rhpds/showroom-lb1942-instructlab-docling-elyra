== Overview

One of the main challenges of fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) is sourcing and processing high-quality training data, as organizations often store knowledge in multiple formats and locations. This information must be converted into a common format in an automated, structured approach. https://docling-project.github.io/docling/[Docling^] is an open source tool that supports parsing and exporting documents to a common readable format. Organizations can then create a knowledge base for fine-tuning LLMs with https://https://instructlab.ai/[InstructLab^].

This lab will walk you through an automated solution to generate an InstructLab https://docs.instructlab.ai/taxonomy/knowledge/file_structure/#__tabbed_1_2[qna.yaml file^] that can be used to fine tune LLMs. We will be using an OpenShift AI https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.19/html-single/working_with_data_science_pipelines/index#idm140613501220224[data science pipeline^] to automate data ingestion, Docling conversion of PDF and DOCX files to markdown, and generating the qna.yaml file. This pipeline contains the necessary HITL (Human In The Loop) steps for ensuring high-quality data in the markdown file and qna.yaml file.

NOTE: Integrating https://hai.stanford.edu/news/humans-loop-design-interactive-ai-systems#:~:text=A%20Different%20Approach:%20Designing%20with%20a%20Human%20in%20the%20Loop[HITL^] is critical for effective AI use. While AI offers efficiency, it's vital to identify points where human involvement is necessary. Critically, a human review of markdown and qna.yaml files is indispensable because AI alone lacks the context and crucial domain knowledge required. Without this human input fine-tuning efforts will likely fail, resulting in repeated attempts that waste significant time and resources.

Many times developers don't have access to data or environments to try out new tools or solutions. Enabling developers to experiment with new tools and test solutions locally can speed up development and help prove out solutions before organizations make the decision to bring those tools into their development clusters.##

This lab will walk you through the persona of a rock star developer that starts locally to build a solution to automate the collection of data files and generation of qna.yaml files for InstructLab. You'll then see how to take that solution locally and deploy it onto an enterprise OpenShift cluster with OpenShift AI.
